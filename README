I have a lot of music.  I also have a lot of hand crafted playlists which represent
certain views of my music 
collection.  Last time I 
checked google music only 
really interfaced with iTunes 
and couldn't import standard playlist file formats.

These "utils" are being built up around this one need, and will be expandeded as
new needs arise.
